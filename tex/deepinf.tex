\section{DeepInf: Social influence prediction}
\subsection{Introduction}
\paragraph{}Social influence is everywhere around us, not only in our daily physical life but also on the virtual Web space.
The term social influence typically refers to \textbf{the phenomenon that a personâ€™s emotions, opinions, or behaviors are affected by others.}. 
Deepinf focus on the prediction of user-level social influence. It aims to predict the action status of a user given the action.
An example for this problem is discussed in the Section 1.
\paragraph{} Deepinf is a deep learning based framework to represent both influence dynamics and network structures into a latent space. The following 
steps are done to predict the action status of a user $\mathcal{v}$, the following
