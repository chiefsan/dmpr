    With more than 2 billion monthly active users, social networking websites have dramatically changed the lives of people. With a range of features and formats, they cater to the interests of a wide range of users. People build social networks or social relationships with other people who share similar personal or career interests, activities, backgrounds or real-life connections. The availability of services on a wide range of devices such as mobile phones, laptops, and computers has made it more accessible than ever. A user can easily access other users' behaviors and is in turn influenced by them. As a result, effective social influence prediction is vital for a variety of applications such as online recommendation and advertising.
    
    In this report, we discuss DeepInf\footnote{Qiu, Jiezhong and Tang, Jian and Ma, Hao and Dong, Yuxiao and Wang, Kuansan and Tang, Jie. 2018. "\textit{Deepinf: Social influence prediction with deep learning}" in \textit{Proceedings of the 24th ACM SIGKDD International Conference on Knowledge Discovery \& Data Mining}, pp.2110--2119.}, an end-to-end framework that learns usersâ€™ latent feature representation for predicting social influence.
