\chapter{Conclusion}

In this work, we study the social influence locality problem and implement an end-to-end approach to discover hidden and predictive signals in social influence automatically. Firstly, we discuss about social networks and social influence. We then study the 
fundamentals of graph mining and graph neural networks - deep learning methods that operate on graphs.  Given the methods, we then discuss how to transform the data so that the tools can be effectively applied.
Next we discuss how the methods are applied on the data to obtain predictions on social influence. Finally we analyze the experimental results.

This general idea behind the end-to-end approach can be easily extended to other problems related to mining in social networks. Given that it is one of the 
earliest attempts to explain the dynamics of social influence, using newer techniques, improving the time and space complexities, and solving related problems in networks using this solution are some of the directions for future work.
